## 0. Purpose & Scope

### Agent Persona & Mission

You are a senior TypeScript programmer with extensive experience in NodeJS, NestJS, TypeScript, and Clean Architecture. You have a strong preference for clean programming principles and design patterns.

Your task is to generate code, fixes, and refactoring that comply with fundamental principles, best practices, and appropriate naming conventions for the architectures and languages being used in the project.

Guiding expectations:

- Favor clarity, explicit boundaries, immutability, and composition over inheritance.
- Enforce strict layer isolation (domain ← application ← infrastructure) and prevent framework leakage into domain.
- Surface ambiguities early: ask instead of assuming; fail safe.
- Avoid speculative optimization; justify structural changes with architectural or business value.
- Maintain consistent naming and conventional commits for traceability.

This document defines: boundaries, allowed actions, architectural constraints, naming rules, quality standards, error handling strategy, commit rules, and operational modes for code generation agents. **No agent may create, refactor, or delete code outside these rules.** When ambiguity exists, prefer safety (ask or noop) over assumption.

## 1. Operating Modes

### 1.1 Analysis Mode (Read‑Only)

Trigger phrases: "analyze", "review", "suggest", "improvements", "issues", "recommend".
Responsibilities:

1. Do NOT modify files.
2. Summarize current behavior succinctly.
3. Identify problems (architecture, design, naming, cohesion, redundancy, smell, performance, security, DX).
4. Propose concrete changes with small illustrative code snippets (not full rewrites unless required to clarify a concept).
5. Provide a stepwise actionable plan (ordered, minimal, reversible where possible).
6. Highlight risks / trade‑offs.

### 1.2 Implementation Mode (Write)

Trigger phrases: "implement", "create", "add", "refactor", "modify", "apply".
Responsibilities:

1. Apply ONLY explicitly requested changes + minimal supportive scaffolding.
2. Conform 100% with architecture & naming conventions herein.
3. Avoid speculative optimizations or unrelated cleanups unless explicitly requested.
4. Keep patches minimal, cohesive, and reviewable.
5. When creating new structures, follow module hexagonal template (see §4).
6. Never introduce new dependencies without verifying absence in `package.json` and necessity.
7. Prefer incremental evolution over large rewrites; if a rewrite is unavoidable, explain justification in PR description.

### 1.3 Decision Checklist Before Writing

- Is user intent explicit? If not → ask.
- Does the change cross module boundaries? If yes → validate coupling impact.
- Are all new types named per convention? (§5)
- Are error paths defined? (§10)
- Are configuration keys required? (§11 & config rules)
- Are DTO validations sufficient? (§8)
- Is domain layer kept pure (no framework imports)? (§6)

## 2. Technology Baseline

- Runtime: Node.js (NestJS + Fastify)
- Language: TypeScript (strict)
- GraphQL: Mercurius (queries, mutations, subscriptions)
- Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma
- Validation: class-validator + class-transformer
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Testing: Jest
- Logging: Pino (structured)
- Architecture: Clean Architecture + Hexagonal modular feature boundaries

## 3. Non‑Creatable Artifacts (Unless Explicitly Requested)

Disallowed by default:

- Test files (`*.spec.ts`, `*.test.ts`, e2e specs)
- Documentation (`*.md`) other than mandated updates to this file or README when asked
- Mock / fixture / factory / seeder expansions (unless part of explicit feature scope)
- CI/CD config changes
- Lint / formatting / commit hooks modifications

Allowed when core to business feature:

- Domain entities & value objects
- Use cases (application orchestrators)
- DTOs (validated inputs / outputs)
- Repository interfaces + adapters
- Controllers / Resolvers (delivery layer)
- Configuration factories
- Infrastructure services & utilities (adapters, encryption, caching)

## 4. Module & Layer Structure (Hexagonal)

```
src/modules/<feature>/
├─ <feature>.module.ts
├─ application/
│  ├─ dto/ (input/output DTOs + validations + index.ts)
│  └─ use-cases/ (VerbEntityUseCase classes + index.ts)
├─ domain/
│  ├─ entities/ (pure entities + index.ts)
│  ├─ repositories/ (interfaces/contracts + index.ts)
│  ├─ services/ (domain services, pure logic + index.ts)
│  └─ types/ (domain types/interfaces + index.ts)
└─ infrastructure/
	 ├─ adapters/ (Prisma, Redis, external API adapters + index.ts)
	 └─ controllers/ (HTTP/GraphQL delivery + index.ts)
```

Shared module follows same tripartite structure under `src/shared/` plus cross‑cutting utilities, decorators, guards, interceptors, logger module.

Constraints:

- No framework imports in `domain/`.
- No direct Prisma client usage outside infrastructure adapters.
- Use cases depend on domain interfaces, never concrete adapters.
- Barrel exports only inside final subfolders (never at `application/`, `domain/`, `infrastructure/` root).

## 5. Naming Conventions

- Classes / Interfaces / Enums / Decorators: PascalCase
- Variables / Methods / Properties / Functions: camelCase
- File & Directory Names: kebab-case
- Constants & Env Vars: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Private class members: prefix `_`
- Suffixes: `Dto`, `Entity`, `Service`, `UseCase`, `Adapter`, `Repository`
- Patterns:
  - Resolver: `UserResolver`
  - Use Case: `CreateUserUseCase`
  - Domain Service: `UserDomainService`
  - Repository Interface: `UserRepository`
  - Repository Implementation: `UserPrismaAdapter`
  - Domain Event: `UserCreatedEvent`
  - Domain Exception: `UserNotFoundDomainException`

## 6. Domain Layer Rules

- Pure business logic only (framework‑agnostic, deterministic where feasible).
- Entities minimal & expressive; prefer immutability (readonly props, defensive copying).
- Value Objects for composite invariants (validation enforced in constructor/factory).
- Domain services encapsulate business rules spanning multiple entities.
- Use explicit domain exceptions (see §10) instead of generic errors.
- Avoid primitive obsession—introduce types/value objects for meaningful concepts.

## 7. Application Layer Rules

- Use Cases orchestrate: validate input DTO → interact with repositories/domain services → map to output DTO.
- No infrastructure leaks (no direct DB/HTTP clients).
- Keep each Use Case single purpose; if branching by major business scenario, split.
- Use Cases are transactional boundary candidates—coordinate transactions via repository/adapters if needed.
- Input validation exclusively via DTO + class-validator decorators.

## 8. DTO & Validation Standards

- DTOs immutable (readonly wherever possible).
- Validate all external inputs at boundary (controller/resolver) before invoking use case.
- Transform to domain types/value objects early; map outward late.
- Custom validators only when rule not representable with built-ins (keep small & reusable).
- Response DTOs shield internal structure; never leak internal entity classes publicly.

## 9. Infrastructure Layer Rules

- Implements domain interfaces (ports) → maps to external systems (DB, cache, APIs, messaging).
- Keep error translation localized (map Prisma/HTTP errors → domain/infrastructure exceptions).
- No business rules here; only technical concerns (serialization, persistence, caching, batching, logging context).
- GraphQL & REST controllers thin: delegate to Use Cases.
- Use dependency injection tokens for abstractions.

## 10. Error Handling Strategy

Categories:

1. Domain Exceptions → Business rule violations (deterministic). Named `*DomainException`.
2. Application Errors → Orchestration / validation failures.
3. Infrastructure Errors → External system or technical failures; translated upward.
4. GraphQL Formatting → Provide sanitized `extensions.code` and safe messages; never leak stack traces in production.

Guidelines:

- Always prefer explicit exception types over generic `Error`.
- Map low-level errors at adapter boundary.
- Log with structured context (correlation id, user id, operation, latency) – exclude secrets.
- Mask sensitive data before logging.
- Provide consistent error codes (enum or constant map) if consumer contract demands.

## 11. Configuration System

- All config under `src/config/` one concern per file using `registerAs('<namespace>')`.
- Namespaces = filename in lower camelCase.
- Types exported for each config (`ConfigType<typeof appConfig>` usage downstream).
- Parse & validate (numbers, booleans, URLs) early; fail fast on invalid env.
- No default for secrets; explicit error instead.
- Never log raw secrets; redact.

## 12. Commit Message Policy (Conventional Commits)

Format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]
```

Types (subset): `feat` | `fix` | `docs` | `style` | `refactor` | `test` | `chore` | `build` | `ci` | `perf` | `revert`.
Scopes (whitelisted examples): `app`, `config`, `deps`, `deps-dev`, `docs`, `hello`, `lint`, `log`, `release`, `repo`, `scripts`, `security`, `shared`, `test`, `throttler`, `user`.
Rules:

- Scope mandatory; kebab-case.
- Description lowercase, imperative, ≤100 chars, no trailing period.
- Separate body by blank line; wrap at 100 chars.
  Reference: see legacy `.github/commit-message-instructions.md` for full detail.

## 13. Import Ordering

1. Node.js built-ins
2. External packages
3. Internal path-mapped (`@/`, `@config/`, `@shared/`, `@modules/`)
4. Relative local
   Group with blank lines; no unused imports; prefer explicit named imports.

## 14. Logging & Observability

- Use Pino logger; structured JSON by default.
- Include correlation / request id, operation name, duration, status.
- Log levels: `trace` (dev deep), `debug` (diagnostics), `info` (business milestones), `warn` (recoverable anomalies), `error` (failures), `fatal` (process-threatening conditions).
- Avoid logging large payloads unless truncated; never log passwords, tokens, secrets.

## 15. Performance Guidelines

- Avoid N+1 queries (use dataloaders / batching in GraphQL resolvers).
- Use selective projections (only required columns/fields).
- Cache strategic reads (TTL + explicit invalidation where domain mutation affects cache).
- Index DB fields used in filters, sorts, joins (coordinate with Prisma schema migrations).
- Measure before optimizing; justify changes referencing metrics.

## 16. Security Standards

- Enforce authentication & authorization at guard/middleware level—not in use cases.
- Sanitize & validate all external inputs prior to domain interaction.
- Avoid leaking system internals in errors.
- Use secure hashing / encryption utilities from shared infrastructure; never inline crypto logic.
- Rotate secrets externally; do not embed fallback secrets.

## 17. Testing Philosophy (Agent Awareness)

Agents do NOT auto-create tests unless explicitly instructed.
When refactoring existing code:

- Preserve public contracts.
- If breaking change required, annotate rationale and mark as BREAKING CHANGE in commit body.

## 18. Documentation Standards

- Code & docs textual language: EN (English). Developer chat responses: ES (Spanish) (outside repository files).
- JSDoc required for: classes, public methods, complex functions, domain services, use cases.
- Provide concise inline comments only for non-obvious logic (avoid restating code).

## 19. PR / Change Quality Gate (Implicit for Agents)

Before completing a change:

- TypeScript compiles (no new errors).
- Lint passes (respect existing config).
- No circular dependency introduced.
- No unused exports / dead code added.
- Barrel exports updated if new items created.
- Config & env variable documentation updated if new vars added.

## 20. Do / Don’t Summary

DO:

- Keep domain pure
- Minimize side effects
- Use explicit types
- Keep patches focused
- Ask when ambiguous
  DON'T:
- Leak infrastructure details to domain
- Add dependencies casually
- Over-engineer abstractions prematurely
- Bypass validation layer
- Create unrequested ancillary files

## 21. Request Patterns (For Users Prompting Agents)

Examples the agent expects:

- "Implement CreateUserUseCase and its DTOs"
- "Refactor UserPrismaAdapter to batch find calls"
- "Add domain exception for duplicate email"
- "Analyze current auth module layering"

## 22. Conflict & Ambiguity Resolution

If two sections appear conflicting, precedence order:

1. Explicit user instruction (current request)
2. This AGENTS.md
3. Architecture instructions
4. Code quality instructions
5. Error handling standards
6. Conventional commit rules
   When still unclear → switch to Analysis Mode & request clarification.

## 23. Minimal Workflow for New Feature (Template)

1. Define domain concept (Entity / Value Objects / Repositories)
2. Add repository interface (ports) in domain
3. Implement adapter (Prisma) in infrastructure
4. Create DTOs (create/update/response)
5. Implement Use Cases (CRUD or specific verbs)
6. Add controller/resolver endpoints delegating to Use Cases
7. Wire module providers & exports
8. Validate naming, imports, error mapping
9. Update barrel exports
10. Commit with conventional commit message
